# VirusTotal

Connect to the virus total and send files(include Compressed files after decompress)

You need import some python packages
- pandas, patool, requests

If you want decompress RAR files, should be install RAR decompress program in your system
- I checked WinRAR

Using API, it take long time analyzing new file(not in VirusTotal Database)

So you should be rescan after long time(several hours or several days)
